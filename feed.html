        <p> We thank Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur for showing solidarity towards this issue too. We, the two media bodies of the campus, are surely going to keep in contact with the administration to ensure that justice prevails. <br><br>We urge every KGPian to contact Prof. B. N. Singh, the election officer, if they are aware of any sort of malpractice that happened in this year's elections. You can also contact Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur or us, or both, to give your statement, in which case, we will ensure total anonymity as we take your help to build the case.<br><br>Thank you. </p>

        <p> Dear KGPians,<br>Yesterday, we as free men and women, exercised one of the most fundamental rights democracy offers us. We voted. We voted for the proposals we liked, the halls we live in, or for a candidate we were friends with. But the important thing is that we voted to ensure that the voices representing us the next year, contains our voice too, however feeble. It was brought to our attention today that there were instances of malpractice, where some students did not get to vote, as their votes were already cast by proxies. There were also instances where certain hall representatives went from room-to-room asking for ID cards of students. We have sources in Azad hall of residence, who said that when they went to vote at around 8:15 PM, their votes were already cast, despite it being compulsory for officials to stay at the polling booths to verify identity. Due to the low margins of victory, these votes might have decided results, in several cases. You may say "But hey, this happens every year". It might, but we cannot do the same things over and over and expect different results. The voices of people who could not vote are not represented in this election, and we as rational students of science cannot allow for this sort of corruption in a system that represents us all. And it is up to us, as a population to decide if we must let this slide, or make sure the authorities address these concerns in an appropriate manner. <br><br>We're in talks with the concerned authorities and will update about any progress, here. If you went to vote and your vote was already cast, or you know of someone to whom it happened, do send us a message. We will reach out to you as soon as possible. </p>

        <p> The Scholars' Avenue was very disappointed at finding chits like these spammed throughout the different halls of residence mentioning the names and posts of different candidates (Including both VP candidates). According to our minion-esque understanding of the gymkhana Constitution, this activity at least is an illegal one. Even if the candidates themselves did not advocate this cheap-trick publicity, their supporters are trickling illegitimacy to their candidates.<br><br>The Scholars' Avenue urges all its followers to tear away all such chits at sight. Also, don't vote for people just because they are in your hall, 'pact' or society. Make your decision based on your intellect. After all, humans didn't evolve from apes to behave like sheep.<br><br>TSA is disappointed by the extreme illegal campaigning conducted by the supporters of either candidature. We thought that these respectable groups were better than this. Don't you think KGPians are smart enough to cast their votes based on the SOP alone? Or don't you trust your candidates enough?<br><br>We also found instances of defamation attempted at both the vice-president candidates. Clearly, either candidate cannot run away from the responsibility of this happening, because their close supporters seem to be the advocates of the defamatory posts against the other candidate. If this is happening, TSA has no trust on the ethical construct of either candidate, and is very apprehensive of next year's state of affairs in KGP.<br><br>We're sending this exact post to the election officer. We suspect nothing will happen, but that will only deepen our lack of faith in the entire election system. </p>

        <p> ‘The Candy Saga’ is a work of fiction. It really is, I swear on earth.<br>*Earthquake*<br><br>This election season, a few journalists from The Scholars’ Avenue noticed that although, invariably always, there are more than two probable VP candidates, towards the end, almost every year, only two individuals end up contesting for the post. Irked with curiosity, they set out to find out what are the criteria that filters the final candidates contesting for the office. The following piece tries to highlight random findings during this pursuit in a deliberately humorous manner. Lightheartedness is expected of the reader.  <br>http://www.scholarsavenue.org/poltucally-incorrect-2/the-candy-saga/ </p>

        <p> Interhall Technology General Championship<br><br>Event: Tech Quiz<br><br>Tentative Standings:<br>GOLD: Nehru with 371.5 points<br>SILVER: RP with  365.5 points<br>BRONZE: Patel with 310.5 points<br><br>However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the quiz: there is some contention between RP and Nehru over a question, the result might change.<br><br>A new rule was introduced for this quiz: the points scored in the preliminary round would be carried forward to the final round. It was later found that in the preliminary round, the scorers had given points to Nehru for an answer of Slug-line' in place of 'slug' but not to RP for 'Synaptic' in place of 'Synaptics'. This resulted in a perceived discrepancy in points, which were carried forward to the final round, and ended up deciding the winner: the final margin of victory was only 6 points. <br><br>In the quintessential KGP way, the GSecs and team members of various halls swarmed the quizmaster, demanding justice. This even delayed the Business quiz, which was to begin soon after. We still await a resolution of the issue.<br><br>The teams:<br>Patel: Mihir Rege, Arkopal Datta, Vikas Srivastava, Srihari Radhakrishna<br><br>RP: Arijit Patra, Saumaric Dangwal, Ankesh Anand, Adarsh Mane<br><br>Nehru: Kumar Abhishek, Anuvab Mohanty, K Shasank, Abhishek Bose<br><br>Irrespective of the final standings, The Scholars' Avenue congratulates all the winners. </p>

        <p> The year is 2035. KGPians are (s)toked about the release of Star Wars: Episode XII, all set to hit cinema screens this Friday, but a trip to Calcutta beckons. Why, you ask? Because, ‘DC’ does not exist. It’s a myth! There are no free downloads. No new movies. No more binge watching. Or, to put it cornily, ‘Hit Hi FiT Hai’ neither has hits, nor is fit.<br><br>Sounds scary, right? We, at The Scholars’ Avenue, have reason to believe that this dystopian future might very well be a reality. How? Well, let us walk you through a series of events which unearthed enough evidence for us to believe so. </p>

        <p> SPIC MACAY(Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music And Culture Amongst Youth),  is a non-political, nationwide, voluntary movement that aims to bring our rich and priceless cultural heritage in vogue, especially among the youth through various activities like Indian classical music and dance, yoga, art and craft workshops, talks  and a number of endeavours oriented to pan-Indian flavour. It was founded in 1977 by Dr Kiran Seth, Professor-Emeritus at IIT-Delhi, a ‘Padma Shri’ awardee for his contribution to the arts in 2009. Dr. Kiran Seth happens to be an IIT Kharagpur alumnus (Mechanical Engineering department) who pursued his MS in 1971 and PhD in 1974 from Columbia University.<br>Few days back, the IIT Kharagpur’s chapter of SPIC MACAY organised “Vasant Vihar”, a series of classical evenings that observed live dance, vocal and instrumental performances over a period of 3 days from March 1 to 3. First evening witnessed Oddisi dance (one of the eight classical Indian dances that still sustains) by Smt. Kavita Dwivedi. Next day’s agenda was solely comprised of Hindustani vocals by Pdt. Omkar Dadarkar. The concluding evening witnessed vocals in Dhrupad style, one of the oldest surviving forms of Indian classical music by Pdt. Uday Bhawalkar and his pupils. The last piece of the evening was melodies of Sarod by Pdt. Tejendra Majumdar accompanied by Shri Subhankar Banerjee on table. The audience was primarily comprised of faculty members, and only a meagre population of the students, evidently showing the declining interests for classical music among the youth, one of the major challenges of SPIC MACAY. Nevertheless, the flair of the maestros for classical understanding and the unison of their emotions with the instruments received warm applause from the audience engrossed in the unfathomable depths of harmonious ragas and elegant dhuns<br>The Scholars’ Avenue talked to Pdt. Uday Bhawalkar after his performance on the third day. Regarding his pursuit of music, he said, “It takes at least 20 years to reach a level of mastery when it comes to any form of art. Dedication, passion and patience are the keywords and one should refrain from discussing completeness and perfection in the realms of art. Focus should not be on worldly hurdles and aspirations but should be on the profoundness of spiritual bliss that you get when the spontaneity of music overtakes you. Ragas remain same, the way of presentation changes according to subject. ”<br>Regarding the overall decline of interest in indigenous cultural music he added “Regardless of increasing pace of life and declining sensitivity of people towards this music , there are still a good number of dedicated people who will carry this  like nobody was singing Dhrupad but I do . It’s not going to finish. Things will change with time.” </p>

        <p> A Notice from the CDC regarding the sessions on 10th March, Thursday, for all non-final year students.<br><br>Dear Students,<br>As the academic year draws to a close, we hope your experience so far has been exciting and fruitful.

These insights are applicable for any career path, be it a job, higher studies or civil services. On 10th March, Thursday, we will be having three 30 minute sessions where we will be sharing our data-driven findings on previous placements/internships, feedback received from students and companies, bottlenecks during placements and how to best overcome them. We will also share what we have learned about preparation for Graduate School Applications and the Civil Services Examination at the end of each session, which interested students can choose to attend.<br><br>We highly recommend that you attend this session, and make the rest of your stay at KGP as productive as possible. <br><br>Date : 10th March, Thursday<br>Venue : Kalidas Auditorium<br><br>Session 1 : CDC10001 : Careers - A Fundamental Approach<br>For : 1st year students<br>Time : 06:15PM - 06:45PM<br><br>Session 2 : CDC31001 : Careers - The Road Ahead<br>For : all 2nd year students. 3rd year Dual degree/MSc/B.Arch students<br>Time : 07:15PM - 07:45PM<br><br>Session 3 : CDC51001 : Careers - Winter Is Coming<br>For : 3rd year B.Tech, 4th year Dual degree/MSc/B.Arch students<br>Time : 08:15PM - 08:45PM<br><br>If you have any queries you can contact Ankur from the placement committee team.

        <p> A rigid and a not-so-transparent tender system coupled with the invisible hold of unions, and a broken policy on change in mess costs have exacerbated the situation in private contractor run messes on campus. The last month has seen two private contractors quit with many more en route and an increase of 7Rs in daily food cost per student.<br>The Scholars' Avenue brings you an extensive coverage of the ongoing crisis.

        <p> The Scholars' Avenue will be conducting another AMA session with Atal Ashutosh Agarwal on Thursday, 3rd March from 8pm to 10pm at http://redd.it/48hh9r.<br><br>Last semester, We had organized the first of a series of Ask me Anything sessions. For those of you who missed it, AMAs or "Ask Me Anything"s are posts on Reddit, where users can collectively interview the host. Users post questions on the host's post, and the host responds to them. This was taken up to widen the band of interaction between students and the VP as well as to facilitate the redressal of students concerns. We saw an overwhelming response, which extended the session by a good couple of hours. A lot of questions were raised and suggestions were offered.<br>Find a quick recap of the first session here: http://www.scholarsavenue.org/news/ama-with-atal-ashutosh-agarwal/<br>Find the entire AMA thread including my responses here: http://tinyurl.com/zw5akbd<br>Find here the follow up action on specific issues: http://www.scholarsavenue.org/news/following-up-with-the-vp/<br><br>Atal is back with yet another AMA session to talk about the progress that has been made and to address any other issues you may have. We encourage you to ask him about halls, academics, internships, placements, campus initiatives, Gymkhana activities, or anything else that's on your mind. All students, faculty members and alumni are welcome to participate!<br><br>Note: To post questions, you must have a Reddit account. It's extremely simple to sign up for one - you don't even need to provide an email id.  Go to http://redd.it/48hh9r , open the post and submit your question as a comment. To ensure that your questions reach him, post your questions before the AMA begins at 8pm today. </p>
