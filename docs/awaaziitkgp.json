JVM is a school where under-privileged students are taught free of cost and is entirely managed by GYWS, a student body in IIT Kharagpur. The event started off with an opening note by the president of AIESEC IIT Kharagpur, Mr. Vinayak Mahbubani in which he thanked the sponsors for the event namely Yes Bank, Syndicate Bank and the alumni network of AIESEC IIT Kharagpur. The drawing competition was the first event in which the students passionately expressed themselves by painting their thoughts on a sheet of paper. Some teachers participated too, and they impressed the judges with their work. The Interns from countries like Portugal, Malaysia, Germany, and Egypt were also present at this event and enthusiastically made some paintings reminiscing on their childhood. The drawing competition was followed by a sports competition which consisted of track field events of children like the balloon bursting, lemon race etc. Balakalakaar ended with a cultural event in which the tiny tots danced and made everyone exclaim at their cuteness. Here are some of the glimpses from the beautiful event."}, {"pic": null, "created_time": "2016-08-28T15:14:56+0000", "message": "The final version of CV module for placements will be opened tomorrow for data filling and CV generation.\nPlease save the current copies of your CVs (CV1, CV2, CV3) from the ERP for saving the data as the new version may remove some of your old data.\nYou will be able to enter the data by simply copying from the old CV.\n                                                                      \n                                                                    --Chairman, CDC", "link": null, "id": "146188872068143_1201272533226433"}, {"pic": null, "created_time": "2016-08-28T15:14:56+0000", "message": "The final version of CV module for placements will be opened tomorrow for data filling and CV generation.\nPlease save the current copies of your CVs (CV1, CV2, CV3) from the ERP for saving the data as the new version may remove some of your old data.\nYou will be able to enter the data by simply copying from the old CV.\n                                                                      \n                                                                    --Chairman, CDC", "link": null, "id": "146188872068143_1201272533226433"}, {"pic": null, "created_time": "2016-08-28T06:44:47+0000", "message": "A Research paper by IIT Kharagpur has been published in the Royal Society of Chemistry Journal, Molecular BioSystems which says that Green Tea can help control Cataract.\n\nThe paper was published by Professor Swagata Dasgupta (Department of Chemistry) with her research team .
