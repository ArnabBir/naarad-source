Mr. Bhaumik himself has donated 11 million USD for the center. The project which was sanctioned in June this year had its foundation stone laid on last Friday by the US Secretary of Education to the President Obama, Mr. John King. <br>  <br> Born into an extreme poor family in a remote interior village in Siuri (Erstwhile Medinipore, British India), Bhaumik had to walk 4 miles barefooted to reach his school. It was during the Great Bengal Famine of 1943 amidst the Quit India Movement when Bhaumik had to sleep for several days without dinner; that he became resolute in his fight against poverty. He went on to obtain his B.Sc followed by an M.Sc from the University of Calcutta. After the inception of IIT Kharagpur in 1951, he studied Resonant Electronic Energy Transfer in Quantum Physics here and was the first to be awarded a Ph.D degree at IIT Kharagpur. He further worked with the eminent Mathematical Physicist Satyendra Nath Bose (the same after whom the SN Bose Auditorium has been named) and has been doing extensive research work in the branches of Bose-Einstein Condensate Theory. He was awarded the prestigious Padma Shri in 2011 by the then President of the Republic of India, Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil. Besides wining numerous scientific awards, he is an eminent author both in Bengali and English, runs several academies for the poor and is a noted philanthropist. <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur proudly congratulates Mr. Bhaumik for his achievements and wishes him a long and healthy life! <br>  <br> With inputs from The Time's Sunday Supplement (The New York Times) and UCLA Newsroom", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_date": "31-08-2016 ", "real_time": "02:11PM", "pic": "1203390296347990.png", "id": "146188872068143_1203390296347990"}, {"link": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/17-year-old-unschooled-mumbai-girl-malvika-joshi-makes-it-to-mit/story-EQxDf2NFS5TReDc6Ix3iEJ.html", "created_time": "2016-08-31T02:50:04+0000", "message": "Good Morning Folks! <br> We hope all your days are running well.
