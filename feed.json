The rising issues of violence and internal conflicts in the prominent institutes of India is really disappointing and alarming too to some extent. We all are aware of the situations in Srinagar, if not through the so much reliable sources but through the very media sources available to us. \n\nOn Thursday, after India lost the World T20 semi-final to West Indies, some students from the locality of Kashmir chanted anti-India slogans and started bursting firecrackers.   It all started with the match between India and Pakistan. There were minor clashes and anti-India sloganeering. But things got worst after the semifinal. In retaliation to what happened students from outside Kashmir waved the Indian Tricolor and chanted \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 and since then NIT Srinagar has turned into a battleground. According to one student \u201cEven on Friday, a group of students assembled on the campus and raised anti-India and pro-Pakistan slogans. Many outsiders also joined the protests\u201d. \n\nThings were kind of normal till then also, but it turned out worst when the local police instead of being the saviour and the protector became the demons of the students' dreams. They beat students mercilessly, snatched the Indian Flag from the protesters and what not. Peaceful protesting students were lured out by the police making an excuse of interaction with media and then ruthless lathi charge began and the students were thrashed mercilessly.\n\nAmidst this crisis, the Non-Kashmiri students were told to vacate the hostels while they are getting life threatening calls from separatist elements outside the campus. Even girls were not spared, they too were given the threats of rapes. \n\nAccording to the recent news, 11 student representative including a woman student were secretly taken to a meeting with Deputy CM and Education minister of Jammu and Kashmir. The students have been assured of their safety and promises have been made to take steps to make the situation easy for the students. \n\nThe irony of the act is that it was due course of time when similar situations arose in JNU campus too and then no policemen were allowed to enter the university and now there in Srinagar, the Police entered the premises, thrashed the students and no one dared to say anything. \n\nThis one big and life threatening incident didn't hit the internet as another trp gaining so-called popular happenings. This only came into common peoples' notice when #NITSrinagar became trending on twitter. Once again Indian media has failed themselves.", "pic": null, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "created_time": "2016-04-09T07:38:06+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1115182695168751"}, {"message": "We thank Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur for showing solidarity towards this issue too.

The mess tables are not there in their usual place, instead old tradition mattresses are put on. You wonder what\u2019s going on. Is this some kind of fest or grand dinner? But unlike grand dinner, there is something very sweet and historic about it. \nWay back in 1990 when the mess workers of RK Hall were on indefinite strike and students were left to starve, one of the student named Anton Pios took the initiative to feed the students. He along with the other senior boarders of the Hall cooked food and fed everyone. This event was more of a symbolic importance as it established the fact that IIT Kharagpur students are capable of rising above the storms while fighting with the odds. \nThat gesture by Anton Pios had such a deep impact that the boarders of RK Hall have commemorated that event ever since by celebrating Anton Pios Day in the first week of April every year since 1991. A simple event in which seniors serve you food and mouth feed you with such number of rasgullas that you might not have eaten in literally your life. \nEvents like this re-establish the beautiful relationship between seniors and juniors that has been ordained by generations of students over decades of years.
