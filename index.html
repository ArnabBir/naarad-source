              <p> Career Development Center introduced a new system of CV generation for the Internships and Placements 2016-17 this year. Right from the inception, students have been facing many problems with this system and CDC has taken many timely inputs from the students and has made an ample number of changes in the system till date, but it is not up to the mark and the students are still struggling with this method. It has now reached the level of higher complexity. We have decided to take up this issue and we request the Placement Junta to participate in this survey and help us to raise this important issue as the deadline of registration is approaching fast (22nd Aug) . We'll be sending the analysis  of this survey to the concerned authorities for the necessary actions.<br>http://tinyurl.com/hdjalm5 </p>
