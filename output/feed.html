        <p> Information dissemination has always been our key concern. We have noticed that that people often miss opportunities/events because of the lack of information propagation. Mass mail often reaches all students. Therefore, we are presenting a solution to this. A common google group which will contain all institute and TSG related updates.<br>I request you to join this group-<br><br>https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/technology-students-gymkhana-iit-kharagpur </p>

        <p> First JNU and now NIT Srinagar. The rising issues of violence and internal conflicts in the prominent institutes of India is really disappointing and alarming too to some extent. We all are aware of the situations in Srinagar, if not through the so much reliable sources but through the very media sources available to us. <br><br>On Thursday, after India lost the World T20 semi-final to West Indies, some students from the locality of Kashmir chanted anti-India slogans and started bursting firecrackers.   It all started with the match between India and Pakistan. There were minor clashes and anti-India sloganeering. But things got worst after the semifinal. In retaliation to what happened students from outside Kashmir waved the Indian Tricolor and chanted ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ and since then NIT Srinagar has turned into a battleground. According to one student “Even on Friday, a group of students assembled on the campus and raised anti-India and pro-Pakistan slogans. Many outsiders also joined the protests”. <br><br>Things were kind of normal till then also, but it turned out worst when the local police instead of being the saviour and the protector became the demons of the students' dreams. They beat students mercilessly, snatched the Indian Flag from the protesters and what not. Peaceful protesting students were lured out by the police making an excuse of interaction with media and then ruthless lathi charge began and the students were thrashed mercilessly.<br><br>Amidst this crisis, the Non-Kashmiri students were told to vacate the hostels while they are getting life threatening calls from separatist elements outside the campus. Even girls were not spared, they too were given the threats of rapes. <br><br>According to the recent news, 11 student representative including a woman student were secretly taken to a meeting with Deputy CM and Education minister of Jammu and Kashmir. The students have been assured of their safety and promises have been made to take steps to make the situation easy for the students. <br><br>The irony of the act is that it was due course of time when similar situations arose in JNU campus too and then no policemen were allowed to enter the university and now there in Srinagar, the Police entered the premises, thrashed the students and no one dared to say anything. <br><br>This one big and life threatening incident didn't hit the internet as another trp gaining so-called popular happenings. This only came into common peoples' notice when #NITSrinagar became trending on twitter. Once again Indian media has failed themselves. </p>

        <p> We thank Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur for showing solidarity towards this issue too. We, the two media bodies of the campus, are surely going to keep in contact with the administration to ensure that justice prevails. <br><br>We urge every KGPian to contact Prof. B. N. Singh, the election officer, if they are aware of any sort of malpractice that happened in this year's elections. You can also contact Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur or us, or both, to give your statement, in which case, we will ensure total anonymity as we take your help to build the case.<br><br>Thank you. </p>

        <p> Dear fellow KGPians,<br>Just a few days back, KGP elected their new Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur student representatives but who would have had a thought that in the place where brightest minds of India resides, cases of booth capturing and vote rigging will be spotted. We being a media body are reporting this after receiving several messages from students across various Halls of Residence who are willing to give their written testimony on this matter. It was brought to our attention that there have been cases in some halls where students were sent back as their votes were already casted by proxies and votes of the people who are currently not in the campus were also cached. Moreover, there were cases, where certain hall representatives went from room-to-room asking for ID cards of students and instances of malpractice, where some students did not get to vote were also witnessed. <br>We appreciate the efforts made by The Scholars' Avenue in reporting such an issue of the campus. The voices of people who could not vote are not represented in this election, and we as being the students of science cannot allow for this sort of corruption in a system that represents us all. Due to the low margins of victory in various posts, these votes might have decided results. You may wonder that why are we hyping such a thing when such practices are quite common in TSG elections every year. We are doing this because we believe that on the ethical grounds such malpractices need a permanent break and the start on this must be an immediate one.<br>All in all, for such a stop to happen, we all have to stand united and make sure the matter doesn’t slide from us by ensuring that the authorities address these concerns in an appropriate manner.<br>We and the Team TSA are keeping a regular contact with the authorities and are making all our efforts to make a full stop to such practices and  are pretty hopeful that authorities would take necessary steps that are legitimate to the student community. </p>

        <p> Walking down the lane, after those exhaustive lab sessions you reach RK Hall and find yourself in between a great hustle with a lot of enthusiastic faces. The mess tables are not there in their usual place, instead old tradition mattresses are put on. You wonder what’s going on. Is this some kind of fest or grand dinner? But unlike grand dinner, there is something very sweet and historic about it. <br>Way back in 1990 when the mess workers of RK Hall were on indefinite strike and students were left to starve, one of the student named Anton Pios took the initiative to feed the students. He along with the other senior boarders of the Hall cooked food and fed everyone. This event was more of a symbolic importance as it established the fact that IIT Kharagpur students are capable of rising above the storms while fighting with the odds. <br>That gesture by Anton Pios had such a deep impact that the boarders of RK Hall have commemorated that event ever since by celebrating Anton Pios Day in the first week of April every year since 1991. A simple event in which seniors serve you food and mouth feed you with such number of rasgullas that you might not have eaten in literally your life. <br>Events like this re-establish the beautiful relationship between seniors and juniors that has been ordained by generations of students over decades of years. Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur takes this opportunity to thank Anton Pios for everything he did and to congratulate all those boarders of RK Hall who have not led this legacy to die. </p>

        <p> Dear KGPians,<br>Yesterday, we as free men and women, exercised one of the most fundamental rights democracy offers us. We voted. We voted for the proposals we liked, the halls we live in, or for a candidate we were friends with. But the important thing is that we voted to ensure that the voices representing us the next year, contains our voice too, however feeble. It was brought to our attention today that there were instances of malpractice, where some students did not get to vote, as their votes were already cast by proxies. There were also instances where certain hall representatives went from room-to-room asking for ID cards of students. We have sources in Azad hall of residence, who said that when they went to vote at around 8:15 PM, their votes were already cast, despite it being compulsory for officials to stay at the polling booths to verify identity. Due to the low margins of victory, these votes might have decided results, in several cases. You may say "But hey, this happens every year". It might, but we cannot do the same things over and over and expect different results. The voices of people who could not vote are not represented in this election, and we as rational students of science cannot allow for this sort of corruption in a system that represents us all. And it is up to us, as a population to decide if we must let this slide, or make sure the authorities address these concerns in an appropriate manner. <br><br>We're in talks with the concerned authorities and will update about any progress, here. If you went to vote and your vote was already cast, or you know of someone to whom it happened, do send us a message. We will reach out to you as soon as possible. </p>

        <p> The Scholars' Avenue was very disappointed at finding chits like these spammed throughout the different halls of residence mentioning the names and posts of different candidates (Including both VP candidates). According to our minion-esque understanding of the gymkhana Constitution, this activity at least is an illegal one. Even if the candidates themselves did not advocate this cheap-trick publicity, their supporters are trickling illegitimacy to their candidates.<br><br>The Scholars' Avenue urges all its followers to tear away all such chits at sight. Also, don't vote for people just because they are in your hall, 'pact' or society. Make your decision based on your intellect. After all, humans didn't evolve from apes to behave like sheep.<br><br>TSA is disappointed by the extreme illegal campaigning conducted by the supporters of either candidature. We thought that these respectable groups were better than this. Don't you think KGPians are smart enough to cast their votes based on the SOP alone? Or don't you trust your candidates enough?<br><br>We also found instances of defamation attempted at both the vice-president candidates. Clearly, either candidate cannot run away from the responsibility of this happening, because their close supporters seem to be the advocates of the defamatory posts against the other candidate. If this is happening, TSA has no trust on the ethical construct of either candidate, and is very apprehensive of next year's state of affairs in KGP.<br><br>We're sending this exact post to the election officer. We suspect nothing will happen, but that will only deepen our lack of faith in the entire election system. </p>
